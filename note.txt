jquery is tailor-made for selecting html elements and performing some action on them

basic syntax:
    $(selector).action()

Examples:
$(this).hide() - hides the current element.
$("p").hide() - hides all <p> elements.
$(".test").hide() - hides all elements with class="test".
$("#test").hide() - hides the element with id="test".

$(document).ready(function(){

  // jQuery methods go here...

});

most jquery codes follow this template
this is to make sure the document is fully loaded

to install jquery:
  just download the js file (dev version)
  (production version is minimized and compressed)

there is a shorter version of it as well:
$(function(){

  // jQuery methods go here...

});

jquery selectors are based on css selector queries
they all start with dollar sign and parentheses: $()


to find an element with unique id (all ids must be unique in page):
$("#test")


to find elements with a certain class:
$(".test")


you can attach multiple event handlers to an element with on() method:
$("p").on({
  mouseenter: function(){
    $(this).css("background-color", "lightgray");
  },
  mouseleave: function(){
    $(this).css("background-color", "lightblue");
  },
  click: function(){
    $(this).css("background-color", "yellow");
  }
});


get DOM content with the following methods:
  text() - sets or returns text content of element
  html() - sets or returns the content of element with html markup
  val() - sets or returns the value of form fields



IMPORTANT: better code structure in get_content.html

AJAX is a technology to manage content of the web page without reloading.
AJAX can be done without jquery, but every browser has a bit different implementation of it, so it needs more work.

'jquery ajax' solves this problem.


for testing jquery axaj need some other files such as a demo_test.txt with the following content:
  <h2>jQuery and AJAX is FUN!!!</h2>
  <p id="p1">This is some text in a paragraph.</p>
